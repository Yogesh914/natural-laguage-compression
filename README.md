# natural-laguage-compression

This project is a program that can squeeze words of sentences together, Natural languages have frequently been compressed, according to linguists, yet they are still quite simple to comprehend because humans are adept pattern hunters. For instance, you may understand what I was attempting to say if I mistyped the phrase "they arevolutionary" as "they are revolutionary"

The input (from standard input) will consist of a sentence on each line, you can assume that single spaces separate each word. Squeeze each individual line and output the result (each on their own line). The program processes all input until EndOfLine (EOF) is the input.

 Example Input:
Ferrets are really super cool. 
But they aren't great at eating dessert. 
I like triking around campus with my dog Mal but he likes scaring squirrels. 
Things can get tricky yet, time me means answer error. 

Expected Output:
